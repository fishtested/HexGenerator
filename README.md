A simple page that automatically generates a random hexadecimal color code. It works offline and is so lightweight, you can use it with a QR code! No external scripts or resources.

## How to use it
1. Load the page.
2. Click the hexadecimal code to copy it to your clipboard.
3. Click the "Generate" button to generate another random color code.
